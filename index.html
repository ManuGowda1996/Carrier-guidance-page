        It's a fact that university graduates with an engineering degree earn at
        least 20% more than the average graduate salary. They can also expect to
        earn a lot more during their career than graduates in most other
        subjects studied

            Mechanical engineering is an engineering branch that combines
            engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials
            science, to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical
            systems. It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering
            branches. Most important branch in the Engineering field.

            Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that
            deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical
            and naturally built environment, including public works such as
            roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines,
            structural components of buildings, and railways.

            Electronics and Communications Engineering (ECE) involves
            researching, designing, developing, and testing electronic equipment
            used in various systems. Electronics and Communications engineers
            also conceptualize and oversee the manufacturing of communications
            and broadcast systems.
